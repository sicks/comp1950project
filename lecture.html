                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Methodology taken mostly from people and companies like: Kelly Goto, Jeffery Veen, Adaptive Path, March First, Sapient, but this is a very common methodology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In fact, this is a standard <em>Project Management</em> Methodology adapted to Web Development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Generally, there are 5 accepted phases in Web Development Methodology. They are:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Phase 1: Definition
                                </li>
                                <li>Phase 2: Site Development
                                </li>
                                <li>Phase 3: Design
                                </li>
                                <li>Phase 4: Production &amp; Testing
                                </li>
                                <li>Phase 5: Launch
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                <strong>However...</strong> I have added 2 steps that I think are critical in selecting and maintaining successful projects:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Phase 0: Client/Project Selection
                                </li>
                                <li>Phase 6: Epilogue and Maintenance
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                While these are phases not commonly accepted, they can be the difference between a successful project and a potential disaster.

Send out a 'Standard Project Update' with details of what has been done, what is happening now, and what is required in short order.

                                <li>TONE is also something that can be developed here. The site will have it's own VOICE that communicates with the user. How the words flow together, how expressive or passive the site is. VERY IMPORTANT for some sites.

                                    <strong>Light/Informal QA</strong>: This can be done as a checklist of features, tools and pages within the site. Using the Content Inventory to check off that each page is present, and any requirements documents to check the presence and function of tools and features.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Semiformal QA</strong>: This is a more organized approach that includes a checklist of items at the very least. Start by breaking down the testing into distinct groups: Content, Features and Applications. Each group is tested individually from a users point-of-view by following paths or tasks. A number of scenarios are defined based on the requirements for the system and followed. Errors and ommissions should be noted and submitted for correction. <span class="warning">Note</span>: This is what most project managers will use.

                                    <strong>Formal QA</strong>: This takes the previous level and adds a lot of documentation and, potentially, software to the process. Each task and subtask are mapped out, and each path of tasks/subtasks/subsubtasks are tested. Each test is accompanied by a notation of expected behaviour and experienced behaviour. Bugs are submitted and tracked with a process, likely using software like BugTrack.

                                Once the site has been checked through QA, make sure that you run through a final check on a staging server. All conditions and scripts should be "real-world" instead of development/test data. This can be done easily by getting everyone from the client and development sides to hammer the site for a day or two, just trying out the site.

                        <ul>
                            <li>For this project, you will create a web site that will act as the project home for all of the other documents you will create.
                            </li>
                            <li>This is frequently referred to as a <em>Client Site</em> or a <em>Cliet Project Site</em> and is a place for clients to find information on team members, progress reports, artifacts, examples and more
                            </li>
                            <li>Your client site will be similar to your course homepage, in that it is a central location for all the other documents you are making available
                            </li>
                            <li>Your other deliverables are going to be:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>A Client Project Site created for this project that describes the project and links to various artifacts.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>An Introduction page that describes the project (as you understand it, including the goals of the project) and the members of the team. This page should also list what each team member actually did during the project
                                    </li>
                                    <li>A proto-site that has at least 3 different pages mocked up: the home page, a lecture page and the blog page
                                    </li>
                                    <li>A blog page must be included, and it <strong>must be on Tumblr</strong>. The template you use for the blog must look identical in layout and presentation to your protosite
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Wireframe(s) of the major sections of the site (<a href="wireframe.html">Example lecture page</a>) that you used to design the protosite (done in HTML, Word or Visio). Your designs may have started on paper but they should be ported to digital. These can also be done by using paper prototypes (scanned) or just using a low-tech solution like Word (make boxes in Drawing mode) or HTML (using simple tables)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>In the wireframes, include descriptions of what is included in each content area
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Sitemap (<a href="sitemap.html">Example sitemap</a>) (HTML, Word or Visio). the sitemap is for your proposed site, NOT the client site.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Rationale page - <strong>this is the most important page in your site.</strong> This is where you describe <strong>why</strong> you chose to build the site in the way you have proposed. Make sure you agreee on this in your group!
                                    </li>
                                    <li>All of this should be presented in an <em>HTML 5 compliant web site with CSS-based navigation</em>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
