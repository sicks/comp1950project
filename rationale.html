	<h2>Resolving Issues with the previous COMP1950 course site</h2>
		<p>For the redesign, we've focused on ease of information.  This means a bias towards function over form; this is an academic website after all.  We've strived to keep the information clear as well as structure the navigation in a way that is easy to use, helping the student to find information in a simple manner</p>
		<p>All that being said, we've tried to maintain a sense of style in the redesign.  It can't be boring, either.  Since the lecture notes are the main pillar of the website, we've attempted to structure the lectures in a clean, efficient manner.  This technique is mirrored in the use of the navigation which is designed to "follow along" as the student navigates through the lecture.  All lectures are chronological and broken down into smaller sub-groups, respectively.</p>
		
	<h2>Additions & Accessibility</h2>
		<p>To the redesign, we've added a search feature.  We've also added a resource link on each page for students to further seek out information related to their topic at hand.</p>
		<p>A blog was also incorporated as a way for students to interact with other course members as well as stay updated about current comings-and-goings of the class.</p>
		<p>The navigation was designed in such a way to supply users with all the information they need: previous lectures, contact information, tools, resources and examples, exercises and homework, blog.  We've made it a high priority to have a navigation that accomplishes all these things.</p>
		<p>We've intentionally decide to forego the use of images, multimedia content, and anything other than what helps to acheive the goal of the site: to deliver students information.</p>
		
	<h2>Audience</h2>
		<p>As this <i>is</i> a website for students, we've geared the information and architecture towards students of the class.  However, there are sections of the site (the blog, the homepage) that are accessible to all including, but not limited to, alumni and prospective students.</p>
		
	<h2 class="edit">Edit-ability & Content</h2>
		<p class="edit">In the redesign, we've allowed for you, the client, to be readily able to add and subtract as well as edit content.</p>
		<p class="edit">We subscribe to the idea that each lecture should be made available as the course progresses.  With that in mind, lecture templates have been created and require only content to be inputted as required.</p>
		
	<h2>Marketing Requirements</h2>
		<p>The COMP1950 website is primarily an educational tool.  With that, we've foregone any attempt to devise plans for marketing.</p>
		
	<h2>Cross-browser/Cross-platform Compatibility</h2>
		<p>The design of the website uses HTML5 and CSS3.  We've ensured that each page and line of code has been validated by the WC3.  It follows that, should the website be rendered on an older browser, the website will display gracefully.</p>
		<p>In terms of cross-platform compatibility, the site will render well on mobile phones, tablets, etc, as we did anticipate that these platforms would be used by the audience regularly to access information</p>
